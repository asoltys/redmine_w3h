I adapted this plugin from a number of plugins that were originally 
developed by Eric Davis of Little Stream Software 
http://littlestreamsoftware.com/

Specifically, this plugin originally grew out of various heavily modified 
forks of the following:

* Timesheets Plugin (https://github.com/edavis10/redmine-timesheet-plugin)
* Budget Plugin (https://github.com/edavis10/redmine-budget-plugin)
* Stuff to Do Plugin (https://github.com/edavis10/redmine-stuff-to-do-plugin)
